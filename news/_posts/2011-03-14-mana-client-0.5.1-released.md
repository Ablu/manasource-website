This is mainly a bugfix release, with some minor new features related
to pickup notifications and supported tile map formats. Pasting under X11
was fixed and some branding issues were resolved. Also, German, French,
Russian and Brazilian Portuguese translations were updated.

Thanks to all who have contributed to this release! As usual the <a

provides the detailed list of changes.
