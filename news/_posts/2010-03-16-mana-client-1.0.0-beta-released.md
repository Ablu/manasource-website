title: Mana client 1.0.0-beta released
author: Thorbj√∏rn Lindeijer
---

Almost half a year after we split off from <a
href="http://themanaworld.org/">The Mana World</a> to develop the client
and server independently from a single online world, we now present a
preview of our first release in the form of this beta. The main purpose of
the beta is to get final feedback towards the 1.0.0 release and to see
whether projects based on Mana can successfully use this new version as
their base.

Compared to the last release of this software, then called The Mana
World 0.0.29.1, a lot has changed. The biggest change is no doubt that both
eAthena and the Mana server are now supported from the same binary. We hope
to replace our aging eAthena version with the Mana server later. The other
major change is that the client can pretend to be different games based on
a "branding" file. Stuff like wallpaper, GUI skin and where to download the
server list from can all be customized using this file. We hope other
projects will use this as an opportunity to set themselves apart, while
avoiding a split in the development of the client software.

Too many other changes were made to mention them here. A summary can be
found in the <a
