author: Thorbj√∏rn Lindeijer

This release fixes a few annoyances and other small bugs. It is now easier to
click beings that are close to other beings, NPC trading has been removed from
chat (again), the last emote can now be used and ring and necklace slots were
unswapped. Also, the Finnish, Brazilian Portuguese and Polish translations were
updated.

Thanks to all contributers to this release! The <a

provides the detailed list of changes.
