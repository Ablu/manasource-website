title: The Mana Project Started!
author: Thorbj√∏rn Lindeijer

Excuse the empty and sterile website, but we need to start somewhere!
The Mana project launched, and is from now on an independent entity from
our roots, <a href="http://themanaworld.org/">The Mana World</a>.

There were several reasons to split off this project. One is to allow
other servers/communities based on the same software to cooperate on an
equal level. Depending on a piece of software should be much more
acceptable for a game than depending on a different (but very similar)
game. Another reason is that some developers are bothered by the demanding
and growing player community or don't like the applied rules or politics.
They shouldn't have to leave the development team because of this.
Finally, the Mana project is not limited by the development of a single
game, so there is more room for experimentation with new features or
directions.

It's expected to be a win for everyone, because at the same time it will
allow <a href="http://themanaworld.org/">The Mana World</a> and other
games based on the Mana platform to focus on what they do best: running a
quality server with well developed content and focus on the player
community.
