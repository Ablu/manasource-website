    <div class="body">
    <p>The Mana project builds a complete 2D MMORPG platform. This includes a
    client, server and web component, as well as a library of free content that
    you can use under the terms of the GPL.</p>

    <p>While this project started in 2009, the Mana client, server and web
    components were formerly being developed as part of <a
     href="http://themanaworld.org/">The Mana World</a> since 2004. By
    separating server/client development from a single player community, we
    hope to achieve better cooperation with alternative Mana server based
    projects.</p>
