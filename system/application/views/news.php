    <div class="body">
    <p>The Mana project builds a complete 2D MMORPG platform. This includes a
    client, server and web component, as well as a library of free content that
    you can use under the terms of the GPL.</p>

    <p>While this project started in 2009, the Mana client, server and web
    components were formerly being developed as part of <a
     href="http://themanaworld.org/">The Mana World</a> since 2004. By
    separating server/client development from a single player community, we
    hope to achieve better cooperation with alternative Mana server based
    projects.</p>

    <h3>Mana client 1.0.0-beta released</h3>

    <p>Almost half a year after we split off from <a
    href="http://themanaworld.org/">The Mana World</a> to develop the client
    and server independently from a single online world, we now present a
    preview of our first release in the form of this beta. The main purpose of
    the beta is to get final feedback towards the 1.0.0 release and to see
    whether projects based on Mana can successfully use this new version as
    their base.</p>

    <p>Compared to the last release of this software, then called The Mana
    World 0.0.29.1, a lot has changed. The biggest change is no doubt that both
    eAthena and the Mana server are now supported from the same binary. We hope
    to replace our aging eAthena version with the Mana server later. The other
    major change is that the client can pretend to be different games based on
    a "branding" file. Stuff like wallpaper, GUI skin and where to download the
    server list from can all be customized using this file. We hope other
    projects will use this as an opportunity to set themselves apart, while
    avoiding a split in the development of the client software.</p>

    <p>Too many other changes were made to mention them here. A summary can be
    found in the <a
    href="http://gitorious.org/mana/mana/blobs/raw/master/NEWS">NEWS file</a>.
    Go to the <a href="<?= site_url('downloads') ?>">downloads page</a> to get
    the release!</p>

    <h3>The Mana Project Started!</h3>

    <p>Excuse the empty and sterile website, but we need to start somewhere!
    The Mana project launched, and is from now on an independent entity from
    our roots, <a href="http://themanaworld.org/">The Mana World</a>.</p>

    <p>There were several reasons to split off this project. One is to allow
    other servers/communities based on the same software to cooperate on an
    equal level. Depending on a piece of software should be much more
    acceptable for a game than depending on a different (but very similar)
    game. Another reason is that some developers are bothered by the demanding
    and growing player community or don't like the applied rules or politics.
    They shouldn't have to leave the development team because of this.
    Finally, the Mana project is not limited by the development of a single
    game, so there is more room for experimentation with new features or
    directions.</p>

    <p>It's expected to be a win for everyone, because at the same time it will
    allow <a href="http://themanaworld.org/">The Mana World</a> and other
    games based on the Mana platform to focus on what they do best: running a
    quality server with well developed content and focus on the player
    community.</p>
