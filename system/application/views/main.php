    <div class="body">
    <p>The Mana project builds a complete 2D MMORPG platform. This includes a
    client, server and web component, as well as a library of free content that
    you can use under the terms of the GPL.</p>

    <p>While this project started in 2009, the Mana client, server and web
    components were formerly being developed as part of <a
     href="http://themanaworld.org/">The Mana World</a> since 2004. By
    separating server/client development from a single player community, we
    hope to achieve better cooperation with alternative Mana server based
    projects.</p>

    <h3>The Mana Project Started!</h3>

    <p>Excuse the empty and sterile website, but we need to start somewhere!
    The Mana project launched, and is from now on an independent entity from
    our roots, <a href="http://themanaworld.org/">The Mana World</a>.</p>

    <p>There were several reasons to split off this project. One is to allow
    other servers/communities based on the same software to cooperate on an
    equal level. Depending on a piece of software should be much more
    acceptable for a game than depending on a different (but very similar)
    game. Another reason is that some developers are bothered by the demanding
    and growing player community or don't like the applied rules or politics.
    They shouldn't have to leave the development team because of this.
    Finally, the Mana project is not limited by the development of a single
    game, so there is more room for experimentation with new features or
    directions.</p>

    <p>It's expected to be a win for everyone, because at the same time it will
    allow <a href="http://themanaworld.org/">The Mana World</a> and other
    games based on the Mana platform to focus on what they do best: running a
    quality server with well developed content and focus on the player
    community.</p>
